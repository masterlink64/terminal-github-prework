Part II

1) man command pulls up the manual for a certain command.  To scroll you need to use D to scroll down and B to scroll up.  I also have it linked to my scroll wheel.  Click q to quit.

2) -l flag will lists files in a list format with details and -a lists all files and folders including hidden ones.

3) curl https://www.google.com > google.html, this downloads and save contents of google.com tp google.html

4) less google.html

5) less -p hplogo google.html. will look for the text "hplogo" in the file

6) option left/right, to jump between words in terminal

7) control + e, to get to end of line in terminal

8) control + a, to get to the beginning of the terminal

9) option + delete, to delete a word in terminal

10) the difference between a terminal and a shell is that the terminal is the interface to deal with the shell.  Think of how the old computers work where the terminal was a physical terminal to interact with the computer.  The shell handles the actual commands and returns the output.

11). Absolute path is starting from the root directory starting with a forward slash /, followed by whatever directory we are at.  

12) Relative path is just whatever directory we are currently at. Such as "cd Desktop"

13) a flag can be used to modify the behavior of commands. Using "- FLAG".  3 flags we have used are: "-r" with rm, "-l" with ls, and "-a" with ls

14) the -rf with rm command allows us to remove a directory with files inside of it.
